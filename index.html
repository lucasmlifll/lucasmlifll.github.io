        <h1>Rules for Forest Hill Centre</h1>

        <h2>Main / General Rules</h2>
        <p> 1. Use common sense.
            <br>
            2. Don't die of fall damage.
            <br>
            3. Please do not bring in your own food, drinks, or snacks. This is to prevent any allergies or poisoning from occuring. Instead, you can come to the caf√© on-site with plenty of options for you to enjoy!
            <br>
            4. Do not bring in any TNT or dynamite.
            <br>
            5. Don't do activities beyond your level, or anything that you know could be potentially dangerous. It may put you at risk of emotional (or physical) trauma.


        </p>

        <h2>Behavioural Rules</h2>
        <p> 1. Please do not damage other people. Our visitors are very fragile and important to us.
            <br>
            2. Respect others and their property.
            <br>
            3. Follow instructions from staff.
            <br>
            4. Do not throw wet tissues onto the roof so that they stick there forever.
            <br>
            5. Refrain from climbing to any high spaces and jumping off with your body as a parachute.


        </p>

        <h2>Additional / Optional Rules</h2>
        <p> 1. Do not enter the facility wearing any form of cosplay or costume that may be deemed inappropriate.
            <br>
            2. Don't wear shoes into the play centre. 
            <br>
